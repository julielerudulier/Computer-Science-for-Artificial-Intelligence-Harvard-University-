#### Layer 10, Head 2

When processing the sentence "The problem with large language [MASK] is that fundamentally they are incredibly gullible.", the attention diagram for Layer 10, Head 2 appears to have learned a certain pattern: The masked noun attends most to the noun that precedes it, as this noun serves here as an adjective to the masked noun (which was originally the word 'models'). Likewise, the pronouns 'they' seems to attend most to the masked noun ('models') that it replaces.

When processing the second sentence "In October 179 elite [MASK] found their allocated seats for the World Sudoku and Puzzle Championships.", it appears here that the pronoun 'their' which replaces the masked noun - originally, the word 'puzzlers' - attends most to the masked word as well.

Finally, when processing the third sentence "After years of hand-wringing about their future, liberal arts [MASK] now face the chopping block.", the same pattern can be observed: The masked noun (which originally was the word 'departments') appears to attend most to the noun 'art' which precedes it and serves here as an adjective. The pronoun 'they', which appears twice in this sentence, also attends most to the masked noun that it replaces.

Example Sentences:
- The problem with large language [MASK] is that fundamentally they are incredibly gullible.
    --> The masked word here was originally 'models'.
- In October 179 elite [MASK] found their allocated seats for the World Sudoku and Puzzle Championships. 
    --> The masked word here was originally 'puzzlers'.
- After years of hand-wringing about their future, liberal arts [MASK] now face the chopping block.
    --> The masked word here was originally 'departments'.


#### Layer 9, Head 6

When processing the sentence "Handwriting muscles may feel [MASK] with less practice and device overuse.", the attention diagram for Layer 9, Head 6 appears to have learned another pattern: Here the adjective 'handwriting' attends most to the noun it describes 'muscles'. The same is true if we swap the order of noun and adjective: The masked word, which originally was the adjective 'weaker', attends most to the noun it describes, which is 'muscles'.

When processing the sentence "Their joint statement was a [MASK] and eloquent message.", the attention diagram is noisier but we can still observe the same pattern. The masked word (the adjective 'short' originally) attends most to the noun 'message' which it describes.

The same is also true when processing the third sentence. The masked word, which was originally the adjective 'false' seems to attend most to the noun it describes, 'choice'.

Example Sentences:
- Handwriting muscles may feel [MASK] with less practice and device overuse.
    --> The masked word here was originally 'weaker'.
- Their joint statement was a [MASK] and eloquent message.
    --> The masked word here was originally 'short'.
- We reject the [MASK] choice that suggests we can either protect the public or advance innovation.
    --> The masked word here was originally 'false'.
