Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
With only 10 simulations, a team such as Italy went from having a 20% chance of winning the title to 2.5% chance of winning when running 10 000+ simulations.
To some extent, the same trend can be observed with France and Australia. The chance of winning for both countries dropped by more than 2 as the number of simulations increased.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
Knowing that the US actually won the tournament, I would stop once the US appears in the top 3 potential winning countries - so 10 000 simulations.
