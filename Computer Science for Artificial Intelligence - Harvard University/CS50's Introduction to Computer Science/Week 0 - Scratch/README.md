### Week 0 - Scratch
#### In week 0, students learn about Scratch, a visual programming language developped by the MIT.


Week 0's assingment is the implementation of a Scratch project using Chrome.
Specifications for this project can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/0/scratch/).



My Scratch project is a video game and I chose to design all of my sprites and backdrops using an AI online tool named DreamStudio.
