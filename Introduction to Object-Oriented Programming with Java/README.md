## Georgia Tech's Professional Certificate in Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming with Java
This course provides an introduction to the Java programming language. Students learn the basics of Java syntax and explore writing interactive programs that incorporate concepts and constructs like: primitive data types, classes, arithmetic operations, conditionals, loops, arrays, console input and output, methods, and reuse.

Students also get to learn about object-oriented programming by writing their own custom classes that represent real-world concepts and objects, and learn how to organize different (built-in and custom) classes into a programming solution.

Other topics discussed in this course include reusability and inheritance, parent-child class (or subclass-super-class) relationships, abstract classes, UML, interfaces and polymorphism to name a few.
