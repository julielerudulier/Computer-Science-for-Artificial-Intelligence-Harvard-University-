If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
--> We could say that this listener's audio aura is either Purple or Orange. Indeed, by looking at the different song attributes available
--- in the database, we can see that the danceability, energy, loudness and tempo are attributes that have high average values,
--- whereas speechiness on average is really low. This indicates that the listener mostly listens to high-energy and entertaining tracks,
--- which would rather correspond to the Purple and Orange audio auras.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
--> One of the reasons why this aura might not be very representative of the listener is due to the fact that sometimes a Spotify account
--- can be used by multiple people in the same household.
--- Therefore a better way of calculating this aura would be to take into account the genres to which belong the tracks to see if this new
--- attribute confirm our first hypothesis or not.
--- We should also consider taking the timestamp of the listening event into account. What part(s) of the day does this individual listen
--- to spotify? And how many times per day? This could help us better understand their listening habits and therefore help us determine
--- their audio aura more precisely.
