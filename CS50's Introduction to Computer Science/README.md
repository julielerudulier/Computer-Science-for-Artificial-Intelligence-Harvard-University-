## CS50's Introduction to Computer Science

CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike.
An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50 teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. 
Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. 
Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. 
Problem sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.
