## Computing in Python IV: Objects & Algorithms

In part IV, students get to complete their introductory knowledge of computer science with this final course on objects and algorithms. 
Now that they've learned about complex control structures and data structures, they get to learn to develop programs that more intuitively leverage their natural understanding of problems through object-oriented programming. 
Then, they learn to analyze the complexity and efficiency of these programs through algorithms. 

By the end of this course, students are able to write programs in Python that leverage their more natural understanding of data structures by creating objects to represent the structures you work with most often. 

#### What students learn in this course:
- Working with instances of objects in Python.
- Creating new data structures using object-oriented programming.
- Using objects with earlier control and data structures.
- Writing common search algorithms, like linear and binary search.
- Writing common sorting algorithms, like bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.
- Evaluating the computational complexity of algorithms using Big O notation.
