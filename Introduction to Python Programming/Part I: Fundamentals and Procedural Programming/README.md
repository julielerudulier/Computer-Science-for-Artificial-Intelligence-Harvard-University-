## Computing in Python I: Fundamentals and Procedural Programming

This course starts from the beginning, covering the basics of how a computer interprets lines of code; how to write programs, evaluate their output, and revise the code itself; how to work with variables and their changing values; and how to use mathematical, boolean, and relational operators.

By the end of this course, students are able to write small programs in Python that use variables, mathematical operators, and logical operators (e.g. programs that calculate the interest rate necessary to reach a savings goal, or which recommend apparel options based on weather patterns, or calculate a grade based on multiple percentages...).


#### What students learn in this course:
- How a computer processes programming code
- The write-run-debug cycle of writing code, running it, and revising it based on its output.
- Procedural programming, or how to write sequential lines of code.
- Variables, their types, and their role in complex programs.
- Mathematical operators for arithmetic operations, exponents, and more.
- Relational operators for evaluating relative values or set membership.
- Boolean operators for resolving complex logical statements.
