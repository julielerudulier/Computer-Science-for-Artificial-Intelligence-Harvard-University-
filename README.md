# Harvard University's Professional Certificate in Computer Science for Artificial Intelligence
This professional certificate series combines CS50’s legendary Introduction to Computer Science course with a new program that takes a deep dive into the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence. 

This series lead me through the most popular undergraduate course at Harvard, where I was able to learn the common programming languages, then carried that foundation through CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python. 

Through hands-on projects, I gained exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence.

By course’s end, I had gained experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that now enable me to design intelligent systems of my own.
