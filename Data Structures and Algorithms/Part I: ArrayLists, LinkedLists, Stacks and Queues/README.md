## Data Structures and Algorithms I: ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues

This course provides a review of some important Java techniques and nuances in programming. 
It introduces students to time complexity, and threads this concept throughout all data structures and algorithms presented in the course. 
Students get to work with the principles of data storage in Arrays and LinkedList nodes. They program the low-level data structures: Singly, Circular and Doubly LinkedLists; and explore edge cases and efficiencies. 
LinkedLists and Arrays are also used to implement Abstract Data Types, ADTs: Stacks, Queues and Deques. Harnessing the power of recursion to move through these data structures is necessary. 
As the size changes in the data structures, it becomes important to examine amortized analysis of the operations.

#### What students learn in this course:
- Develop mature Java programming skills with the use of generics, references and interfaces
- Understand the principles of data storage in Node objects
- Program various low-level data structures like Singly, Doubly and Circular LinkedLists
- Design and implement ADTs like Lists (backed by Arrays), Stacks and Queues
- Examine the edge cases that occur in these linear data structures
- Analyze the time complexity of linear data structures and their algorithms
- Compute amortized analysis for Arrays, ArrayLists, Stacks and Queues
- Implement recursive methods that operate on linear data structures
- Extend knowledge of these concepts to other structures like PriorityQueues and Deques
