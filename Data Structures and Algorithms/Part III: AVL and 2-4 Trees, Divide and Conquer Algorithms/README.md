## Data Structures and Algorithms III: AVL and 2-4 Trees, Divide and Conquer Algorithms

This course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. 
It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. 

Students investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. 

As they enter the algorithm portion of the course, they begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. 
There is a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. 
Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. 
Divide & Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. 
The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. 
Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. 
LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. 

All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.
