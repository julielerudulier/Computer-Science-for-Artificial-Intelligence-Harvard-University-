## Data Structures and Algorithms II: Binary Trees, Heaps, SkipLists and HashMaps

In this course, students explore the hierarchical data structure of trees.
As students get to learn more about Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Binary Heaps, they get to program BSTs, their operations and traversal algorithms. 

Students then get to learn about heaps. Heaps approach access differently and prioritize what data is accessed. 
They also employ the concept of up-heap and down-heap operations not found in other structures.

HashMaps and SkipLists are the last data structures discussed in the course. 
Students get to investigate different collision strategies and implement one. 
SkipLists are a probabilistic data structures where data is placed in the structure based on a randomization procedure.

#### What students learn in this course:
- Develop mature Java programming skills by using recursion in Tree ADTs
- Investigate different nonlinear, linked data structures: Trees, Heaps, SkipLists and HashMaps
- Study the significant uses and applications of hierarchical tree structures
- Explore tree properties, and categorizing based on shape and order
- Design and implement the binary trees: BSTs and Heaps
- Examine edge cases and efficiencies in BST and Heap operations
- Understand the up-heap, down-heap and build-heap procedures
- Consider the probabilistic data structure, SkipLists, and randomization
- Implement a HashMap ADT with its key-value pairs
- Analyze the different collision strategies with HashMaps
- Compute amortized analysis for Heaps and HashMaps
