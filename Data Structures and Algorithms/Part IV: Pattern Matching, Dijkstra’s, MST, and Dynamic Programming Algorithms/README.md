## Data Structures and Algorithms IV: Pattern Matching, Dijkstra’s, MST, and Dynamic Programming Algorithms

This course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. 

Students delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. 
Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. 
Dijkstra’s algorithm allows students to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. 
They investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. 

Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST and also explored in this course: Prim’s and Kruskal’s.

The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms, as pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. 
Students begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand, and then go further with Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)as, these algorithms improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. 
The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. 

Students get to break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. 
Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.
