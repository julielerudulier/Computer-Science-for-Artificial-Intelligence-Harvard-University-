## Georgia Tech's Professional Certificate in Data Structures and Algorithms

The Data Structures and Algorithms Professional Certificate from GTx is a four-course series covering the foundations of data structures, and designing efficient algorithms. 
Students examine and implement the principles of data storage in low-level data structures such as LinkedLists, Stacks and Queues. 
They get to learn about the significance of Abstract Data Types (ADTs). The fundamentals of recursion, edge cases, and algorithmic efficiency are also emphasized throughout the four-course series. 

The series transitions from linear data structures to nonlinear data structures. 
Students explore Binary Search Trees (BSTs), HashMaps and Heaps. Implementations of the depth-first search (dfs) and breadth-first search (bfs) traversal algorithms are also presented. Higher order data structures, like AVL and 2-4 trees, delves into self-balancing algorithmic techniques. 

Computer scientists must have a thorough understanding of time complexity in order to write efficient algorithms. The 3rd & 4th courses focus on efficiency by first reviewing iterative sorting algorithms, bubble sort, and then implementing optimizations applied the sorting algorithm which improves performance. Divide and conquer algorithms, such as merge sort, quicksort and radix sort, are explained. 

The series wraps up with the graph ADT that utilizes many lower level data structures as auxiliary data storage in order to implement Dijkstra’s shortest path and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms.

Class Central has ranked the “Data Structures & Algorithms” series in GTx as one of the “Top 100 Most Popular Courses of 2021”, as well as, the #5 “Best Data Structures & Algorithms” course sequence in 2023.
