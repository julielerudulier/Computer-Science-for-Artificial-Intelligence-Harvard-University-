## Harvard University's Professional Certificate in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning
This comprehensive certificate program provides learners with practical knowledge in machine learning and its applications. It delves into various facets of data analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning techniques, providing hands-on experience with industry-standard tools like Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy; and in methodologies, including decision trees and ultimately more complex algorithms like gradient boosting.

By the end of this certificate, I was able to gain hands-on experience building and analyzing complex data sets using Python and machine learning, developing strong technical skills in programming with Python and machine learning.
