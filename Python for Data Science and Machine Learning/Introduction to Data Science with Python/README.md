## Introduction to Data Science with Python

Using Python in this course I studied regression models (Linear, Multilinear, and Polynomial) and classification models (kNN, Logistic), using popular libraries such as Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy. The course covers key concepts of machine learning such as: picking the right complexity, preventing overfitting, regularization, assessing uncertainty, weighing trade-offs, and model evaluation. 

By the end of the course, I had a fundamental understanding of machine learning models and basic concepts around machine learning and artificial intelligence.


#### What students learn in this course:
- They gain hands-on experience and practice using Python to solve real data science challenges;
- They practice Python programming and coding for modeling, statistics, and storytelling;
- They use popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Sklearn;
- They run basic machine learning models using Python, evaluate how those models are performing, and apply those models to real-world problems;
- They build a foundation for the use of Python in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
